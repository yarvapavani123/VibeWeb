            <ul>
                <li>Predictive modelling:Predictive modeling is a statistical and machine learning technique used to forecast future outcomes by analyzing historical data. It involves data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, and the application of various modeling techniques, such as regression or classification. Ultimately, the model is evaluated for its accuracy in predicting unseen outcomes, making it valuable across industries like finance, healthcare, and marketing.</li>
                <li>NLP / text processing:Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an AI field focused on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. It employs text processing techniques to analyze and generate language, enabling applications like sentiment analysis, machine translation, and chatbots. By applying algorithms and linguistic rules, NLP converts unstructured text into meaningful insights, enhancing communication and decision-making across various domains.</li>
                
                <li>Computer vision:Computer vision is an AI field that enables computers to interpret visual information, allowing applications like facial recognition, object detection, and autonomous navigation. By using image processing and machine learning techniques, it transforms raw images into actionable insights, significantly impacting industries such as healthcare, security, and automotive.</li>
